# Project Plan

This plan outlines the tasks, timelines, and responsibilities for developing our Software Quality Assurance Handbook.

| Team Reflection & Contributions        | All members                      | Day 7    | `feature/reflection`             |

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Each task will have a dedicated feature branch.
- Two or more members will collaborate on each task.
- All contributions are peer-reviewed via pull requests before merging to `main`.

# Team Reflection and Contributions

## What Went Well

- Abdul Badmos: Clear division of tasks at the start of the project allowed everyone to work independently without confusion.
- Abdul Mannan Akhtar: Everyone contributed to reviewing and proofreading at least one other section, which improved the overall quality.

## What Could Be Improved

- Abdul Badmos: Earlier syncing could have helped avoid small formatting inconsistencies across sections.
- Abdul Mannan Akhtar: A few tasks required clarification mid-way through and could have benefited from a short team catch-up or checklist in the README.

## Lessons Learned

- Abdul Badmos: Using a clear project plan from the beginning made it easier to manage deadlines and responsibilities.
- Abdul Mannan Akhtar: Having two contributors per topic ensured a second layer of review, which improved the quality of every section.


## Final Notes

This handbook project gave us a structured way to practise collaborative software documentation, estimation, and version control. Everyone contributed meaningfully, and we followed the trunk-based development model with active pull requests and feedback. We would adopt a similar workflow for future team-based technical writing.
