# Software Quality Assurance Handbook

## Introduction

As our fast-paced startup continues to grow, maintanining a high standard of software quality is more critcal then ever. This handbook serves as a comprehensive guide to software quality assurance (QA) practices that all team members are expected to follow. With a growing team of 20 software engineers, it is essential that we align on a shared standard of quality to avoid inconsistent workflows, and unstructured practices have led to delays, bugs in production, and a lack of clarity.

By consolidating our quality practices in one place, we aim to create a shared understanding of what "good" looks like across the team. The result should be better collabaoration, fewer defects and greater confidence in every deployment. 

### Why This Handbook Exists

Without clear QA standards, teams tend to fall into siloed practices, undocumented workflows, and inconsistent development patterns. This results in code that is difficult to maintain, unpredictable release cycles, and increased risk during deployment. In startups, where speed is a necessity, quality can often be an afterthought leading to technical debt that slows you down later.

This handbook is designed to pervent that. It aligns the team on a shared approach on writing, reviewing and delivering high-quality software. It will promote consistency while leaving room for flexibility and iteration based on feedback and team growth. It can also help reduce onboarding time for new engineers by providing a single point of reference for expectations and processes.

### Living Document for a Growing Team

As new team members join and projects become more complex, this handbook will remain a central reference point. All engineers, regardless of experience level should be able to use this document to understand our team’s approach to software quality.

The content here is not static. It will evolve based on retrospectives, internal feedback, and changes in best practices across the tech industry. Contributions and updates are encouraged. We treat this handbook the same way we treat our codebase: always improving, always refactoring.


### What You Will Find Inside

Each section of the handbook focuses on a critical area of software quality assurances and contains:

- A short introduction to the topic and why it matters.
- Bullet-pointed best practices and common mistakes to avoid.
- Diagrams or visuals to help communicate complex ideas clearly.
- Links to further reading for engineers interested in learning more.

The content is designed to be concise, pratical and easy to scan. Use this handbook regularly during onboarding, when estimating tasks, reviewing pull requests, or refining your own workflows. This handbook is meant to support day-to-day development and long term team alignment.

If something in this document feels unclear or outdated, we encourage team members to suggest edits. Keeping our quality standards current is a shared responsibility.

### Topics Covered

1. **Task Estimation in Scrum** – Learn how to estimate work effectively to maintain project predictability.
2. **Code Reviews** – Understand how to perform and receive constructive code reviews that improve overall quality.
3. **DevOps Integration** – Adopt best practices for integrating development with operations to reduce all deployment issues and improve reliability.
