# Code Reviews

## Introduction


Code reviews are a key quality control practice used to identify bugs, ensure consistency, and promote shared ownership of code. They help development teams catch issues early and foster collaboration and learning. In this section, we will explore effective code review practices, common mistakes to avoid, and provide useful references to industry standards.

## Best Practices

- **Review in small chunks:** Keep pull requests small (ideally under 400 lines) to ensure focused and thorough reviews.
- **Set clear expectations:** Use documented coding standards and review checklists to align reviewers.
- **Give constructive feedback:** Focus on clarity, design, and logic — not on personal preferences or style.
- **Use automated tools for routine checks:** Let linters and formatters handle style so reviewers can focus on architecture and logic.
- **Review promptly:** Aim to provide feedback within 24 hours to keep the team moving.
- **Praise good code:** Highlight well-written, readable, or elegant code to reinforce good habits.
- **Ask questions instead of making demands:** Phrase feedback as suggestions where possible, e.g. "Have you considered...?"

## Practices to Avoid

- **Overlooking the purpose:** Reviews should focus on things like logic, readability, and maintainability.
- **Giving vague feedback:** Elaboration is necessary to prevent reviewers from being confused and lost. It is important to be specific and helpful.
- **Delaying reviews unnecessarily:** Waiting days to review blocks progress and kills momentum. When you are busy with coding, others should be informed.
- **Being overly critical or personal:** There is no need for personal feedback to be dealt. The criticism should focus on the code only, not the coder.
- **Approving without reviewing:** The entire process is undermined if the code is not approved first.
- **Focusing only on style:** The review should be focused on the value of the criticism more than the presentation.
- **Rewriting the code in comments:** Avoid suggesting complete rewrites unless necessary, focus on meaningful improvements.
