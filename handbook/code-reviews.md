# Code Reviews

## Introduction


Code reviews are a key quality control practice used to identify bugs, ensure consistency, and promote shared ownership of code. They help development teams catch issues early and foster collaboration and learning. In this section, we will explore effective code review practices, common mistakes to avoid, and provide useful references to industry standards.

## Best Practices

- **Review in small chunks:** Keep pull requests small (ideally under 400 lines) to ensure focused and thorough reviews.
- **Set clear expectations:** Use documented coding standards and review checklists to align reviewers.
- **Give constructive feedback:** Focus on clarity, design, and logic — not on personal preferences or style.
- **Use automated tools for routine checks:** Let linters and formatters handle style so reviewers can focus on architecture and logic.
- **Review promptly:** Aim to provide feedback within 24 hours to keep the team moving.
- **Praise good code:** Highlight well-written, readable, or elegant code to reinforce good habits.
- **Ask questions instead of making demands:** Phrase feedback as suggestions where possible, e.g. "Have you considered...?"
