# DevOps Integration

## Introduction

DevOps Integration is an essential component of software development. It provides the necessary tools and practices that businesses need to speed their processes up. There is a lot of work that goes into the integration of DevOps into systems. In this section, the benefits and changes that DevOps can bring into IT will be discussed, as well as general information about DevOps integration.

## Best Practices

- **Integrating automation** is a good process as it can provide an easier and less tedious way for developers to test out processes and new systems.
- **Project management** is important as it can help prevent the project from becoming bloated, and large tasks can be broken down and assigned to employees in an efficient manner.
- **Observation** is necessary, and tracking the flow of work can help prevent errors and issues from having major consequences.

## Practices to Avoid

- **Missing key elements** can cause the entire DevOps process to fall apart.
- **Hiring experienced staff** can be difficult, as the DevOps industry requires significant experience for the best results.
- **Failing to plan for security** requires extra steps to create contingencies in the case of security faults and breaches.
